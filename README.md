# A Golang client for the Nextlinux Enterprise API

Modified from https://github.com/nextlinux/client-go. 
Based on generated code. No executables provided, only intended for use as a library in other projects.

To pull the swagger definition and re-generate all client go code, update `ENTERPRISE_REF` in the Makefile to point to
the desired enterprise commit. Then run the following to regenerate the client:
```bash
make 
```

Note: the version of the enterprise where the swagger spec is pulled from is pinned in the Makefile. 

## Release Strategy:

Currently releases are manual. This table shows the released versions of the client and it's associated enterprise version:

| client version | enterprise version |
|----------------|--------------------|
| v1.0.0         | v4.3.0             |
